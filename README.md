## Chtrrrrrrr Github Pages!
---
Welcome to my own website thanks to the Github pages service
---
The webiste is departed into three sections:  
- Main Page:the original code is from [Dmegoçš„ä¸ªäººä¸»é¡µGithubé¡¹ç›®](https://github.com/dmego/home.github.io?tab=readme-ov-file).(star it right now!).I have modified it to fit my style.
- ~~Neo Chtrrrrrrr Writing: a simple web storing some entertaining papers just for play~~
- ~~Muffin Server Web:emmmm, this is a private minecraft server page for my friends.Don't worry, it has been shut down for a long time.~~

It will be a permanent puzzle for me if you realy find this repository by your selfðŸ˜‚.Rather than looking at my project,why not turn to Dmego's?
